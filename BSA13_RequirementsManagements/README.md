### Preamble <div id="11"></div>

In the survey and design phases, you have been identifying requirements. For the next stages of development, you should determine the order in which certain requirements will be developed, which functional requirements meet key stakeholder goals, business requirements, and stakeholder requirements. And what state they are in: developed, tested, or not yet in the release, not scheduled for implementation. This is what you will be dealing with in the current project. 

The analyst defines stakeholder requirements, identifies business needs, key stakeholder objectives, and formulates success criteria. After coordinating with the customer, the analyst creates functional requirements for the system, and developers implement the software according to those requirements. Testers then test the software. After defects are corrected, testing is performed, and if the customer is satisfied with the test results, the system is put into production. 

In order for the customer to confirm that the system does what it is supposed to do, it is recommended that the tests be performed by someone who has discussed the design with the customer. Or who can explain the consistency between design and implementation. In both the first and second cases, this is the analyst. In addition, the analyst advises both developers and testers during the work process.

### General Rules <div id="21"></div>

1. Along the way, you may feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information: that's OK. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you. So are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate. Search. Use common sense. Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to sources of information. Check. Think. Analyse. Compare. 
3. Look at the text of each assignment. Read it several times. 
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the task itself.
5. You may find inconsistencies where something new in the terms of the task or examples conflicts with something you already know. If you come across such an inconsistency, try to work it out. If not, write it down as an open question and find out as you work. Do not leave open questions unanswered. 
6. If a task seems confusing or impossible, it only seems that way. Try to break it down. It is likely that some parts will become clear. 
7. There will be several tasks. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the more meticulous students. These tasks are more difficult and are not compulsory. But doing them will give you extra experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to fool the system or the people around you. You will fool yourself first.
9. Got a question? Ask your neighbour to the right. If that doesn't help, ask your neighbour on the left.
10. When you use help, you should always understand why and how. Otherwise the help is useless.
11. Always push only to the develop branch! The master branch will be ignored. Work in the src directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III <div id="chapter-iii"></div>

### 1. Requirements Management <div id="31"></div>

In the BSA02 project, you learned about the different types of requirements, their levels, and the relationships between them. 

![](misc/images/img1_eng.png)

In the next projects, we identified and developed different types of requirements:

1) Business requirements; 
2) Stakeholder requirements;
3) Functional requirements for the system;
4) Non-functional requirements.

The requirements of the different levels are interrelated. The following shows how stakeholder requirements for separation of user functions are implemented by functional requirements for access rights to functions. 

Example: User access rights management should be developed. This requirement is described as a stakeholder requirement (which role should perform which functions):

1) which roles interact with the system; 
2) which operations on which entities a role performs on which entities.

But the access control mechanism itself is also described as a functional requirement, and possibly as several different requirements: 

1) where access rights information is located in the system (read access rights of roles); 
2) what the management mechanism is (applying access rights).

For this purpose, stakeholder requirements for the distribution of access rights must be linked to functional requirements describing access rights management. 

The requirements can also be interdependent at the same level. For example, as we saw in the BSA11 project, system functions are related to screen interfaces. Or in BSA12 — quality attributes (non-functional requirements) are related to specific functions.

In addition, even functional requirements should be developed in a certain order so that you don't have to redesign the previously developed requirements during implementation. 

Therefore, you should specify and control the dependencies of requirements and prioritize their development. 

The general scheme of the requirements management process is well illustrated in the book by F. Krachten, Chapter 9 "Requirements Management Process Flowchart". Each requirement has an identifier to provide control over requirements, relationships between requirements (tracing), status of work with requirements, and their implementation. 

Typically, an alphanumeric identifier is used where the letters identify a group of requirements by their types (e.g., business requirements, user requirements, functional requirements, interface requirements, non-functional requirements) and the numeric part of constant length identifies the numbering within the group. 

For example, the Business Requirement Document (BRD) identifier is often used for business requirements. An example of a complete business requirement identifier is BRD000017 (not BRD17). You should also define the characteristics (attributes) and states (statuses) of the requirements. The statuses and attributes of different groups of requirements may be different. The approach to identifying and assigning attributes and states of requirements is well described in chapter 27 of K. Wiegers' book. 

The description of requirements, their identifiers, attributes and states can be stored in a table or database, but it is more useful to store them in a task management tool such as Jira, WEEK or, most effectively, in a requirements management system such as DOORS, ArchiMate and the Russian development, SUTr.  An overview of requirements management systems is given in the article "Requirements management tools: software and everything you need to know" <https://businessyield.com/ru/management/requirements-management-tools/>.

In the current project, you will identify groups of requirements, define their attributes and statuses. Describe the requirements for our tasks and perform tracking for them. 

### 2. Testing <div id="32"></div>

Quality management and testing is a separate major area in software development. The purpose of testing is not to guarantee the quality of the product, but to evaluate it and provide information that can be used to improve the quality. That is, to find and report bugs. 

Since an analyst understands better than other development participants how the system should work, under what conditions what result is expected, they should understand how to prepare data for product quality testing (test cases), how to perform quality testing, and how to describe a defect in the software.

**Software testing** is the examination of the correspondence between the real behavior of a program and its expected behavior. It is performed on a finite set of tests selected in a particular way.

**The purpose of testing** is to confirm or detect software conformance with requirements; to identify defects that should be eliminated before they are discovered by program users.

**Error** is a human action that produces an incorrect result. 

**Failure** is the deviation of a component or system from expected performance, operation, or result.

**Defect** is a flaw in a component or system that may cause the component or system to fail to perform a required function. A defect discovered during execution may cause the component or system to fail.

### 3. Task Management <div id="33"></div>

In addition to requirements management, task management systems (Jira, WEEEK, etc.) are used to manage tasks assigned to executors (analysts, developers, testers). An analyst must be able to read and work on a task assigned to him/her, pass the results to the next executor in the work chain, assign a task to another executor, for example a developer and a tester, register a requirement or an error (defect).

## Chapter IV <div id="chapter-iv"></div>

### Description of tasks

### Task 1. Haircut Appointment <div id="41"></div>

The management of a chain of barbershops decided to implement an online booking system. The main objective is to develop the business by expanding the customer base through the possibility of online registration, as well as to reduce employee labour costs and manual labour by automatically informing customers through communication channels. 

Both registered and unregistered visitors can book an appointment on the website. When making an appointment, they can select the type of service: hairdressing or cosmetology, as well as the service itself, the master and the time from the available intervals. The system should provide automatic sending of reminders to clients through the communication channel chosen by the client (Telegram, WhatsApp, VK, SMS) according to the schedule set by the manager. After receiving a service, the system offers the client to evaluate the service and write suggestions on how to improve the work.

The schedule of masters and the services provided by each master should be entered by the manager, who may be more than one person. This person is also responsible for keeping the schedule up to date and adjusting it if necessary, communicating with customers manually, marking the service, charging and accepting payment, sending the payment data to the accounting department. The manager can also receive reports on completed services and view customer feedback.

Each master has the ability to view the schedule and appointments for their services, as well as customer reviews.

Let's look at the requirements related to the following description in the task:

*The system should provide automatic sending of reminders to clients via communication channels chosen by the client (Telegram, WhatsApp, VK, SMS) according to the schedule set by the manager.* 

**Problem:** Some clients forget that they have an appointment at a barbershop.

**Manager Need:** Remind clients in advance of barbershop appointments.

**Client need**: To be reminded in advance of a barbshop appointment.

**Business Requirement:** Increase the number of clients who sign up for services. Reduce the number of times clients forget the time of their service appointment.
